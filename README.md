<img src="pic\quad_servo_cad.jpg" alt="quad_servo_cad" style="zoom:50%;" />

A low cost 12DOF quadruped, actuated by hobby servos. Notice that this is a early version developed back in 2019. If you're looking for a high performance desktop quad, check out the ongoing [Quadruped bai tiny](https://github.com/psrobotics/Quadruped_bai_tiny)

After printing your parts, insert the bearing at all 5mm holes locates around rotations joints. Then fasten  parts with M3 screws. Remember to check the rotation friction, make sure all joints can rotates freely with the servo installed. 

### Servo selection

The performance of actuators is of fundamental importance for legged robots. Even when we're building a small one. Ideal actuators for this design should be highly back-drivable, have high power density, and be torque-controllable. However, most off-the-shelf servos have nothing to do with these features. There are some high voltage brushless servos (with magnetic encoders for feedback) with relatively good performance, but they're extremely costive at this size. If you have enough budget, why not build a brushless one? Considering that you'll need 12 servos for the assembly, my suggestion is just to go for the budget choice. The EMAX ES08A (metal gear version) works fine for my build. The nylon gear version is also acceptable, but they can easily be damaged under impact.

### Body assembly

The robot consists 4 legs and a body frame. Assembly 2 legs first.

Assembly another 2 mirrored legs. Then link all legs to the body frame.

### Feet Sensor (optional)

Additional feet sensors can detect whether foot have touched the ground. This can be helpful when changing the state machine from 'swing state' to 'ground state'. The foot of Quadruped bai servo is switchable. If you decided to add feet sensors, some additional configurations are needed for the firmware (would be detailly explained later). 

Feet sensors are built around micro switches,  which detect impact from specific directions. As for the result, this design didn't work that well. A good feet sensor solution should be able to detect impacts from all directions, with low latency and clear output. [Open Dynamic Robot Initiative](https://open-dynamic-robot-initiative.github.io/) has presented an elegant solution with infrared sensor. Take that as a reference, the ongoing Quadruped bai tiny will come with better feet sensors. Assembly the feet sensor as this pic shown. (Remember to print mirrored parts for right-side legs)

Only 3 printed parts are needed to assembly the feet sensor, check [STL file](hardware/stl/feet_sensor) here.

In order to increase the friction between feet and ground, additional high-friction coating is vital. I used some glued silicone sheet on the feet tip. You can also design your feet tip and print it with high-friction material.

### Servo Calibration

Most servos have a limited motion range,  make sure the servo's motion range covers leg linkage's joint limit shown in the following pics.  Also, pre-calibrate in this step by applying an initial PWM signal to servos before installing (eg. 0Â°). This enables all servos to have the same PWM-joint angle mapping. You can then fine-tuning them in the firmware.
